### Percentage: Notes and Examples

#### Introduction to Percentage
A percentage is a way of expressing a number as a fraction of 100. It is denoted using the symbol `%`. For example, 50% means 50 out of 100, or simply 50/100.

#### Key Concepts

1. **Basic Formula**: 
   $$
   \text{Percentage} = \left(\frac{\text{Part}}{\text{Whole}}\right) \times 100
   $$
   Where:
   - Part = the value to find the percentage of.
   - Whole = the total or reference value.

2. **Conversion between Fraction and Percentage**:
   - To convert a fraction to a percentage, multiply by 100.
     $$
     \text{Fraction to Percentage} = \text{Fraction} \times 100
     $$
   - To convert a percentage to a fraction, divide by 100.
     $$
     \text{Percentage to Fraction} = \frac{\text{Percentage}}{100}
     $$

3. **Finding the Percentage of a Number**:
   - To find a percentage of a number, multiply the number by the percentage and divide by 100.
     $$
     \text{Percentage of a Number} = \frac{\text{Percentage} \times \text{Number}}{100}
     $$

4. **Finding a Number when a Percentage is Given**:
   - If you know the percentage and want to find the original number:
     $$
     \text{Original Number} = \frac{\text{Given Percentage} \times \text{Number}}{\text{Percentage}}
     $$

5. **Increase or Decrease in Percentage**:
   - To calculate the increase or decrease, find the difference and then divide by the original value, finally multiply by 100.
     $$
     \text{Percentage Increase/Decrease} = \frac{\text{Difference}}{\text{Original Value}} \times 100
     $$

#### Examples with Solutions

1. **Example 1**: What is 25% of 200?
   $$
   \text{Solution: } \frac{25 \times 200}{100} = 50
   $$
   **Answer**: 25% of 200 is 50.

2. **Example 2**: Convert 0.75 to a percentage.
   $$
   \text{Solution: } 0.75 \times 100 = 75\%
   $$
   **Answer**: 0.75 as a percentage is 75%.

3. **Example 3**: If 60% of a class of 50 students passed, how many students passed?
   $$
   \text{Solution: } \frac{60 \times 50}{100} = 30
   $$
   **Answer**: 30 students passed.

4. **Example 4**: What percentage of 120 is 90?
   $$
   \text{Solution: } \left(\frac{90}{120}\right) \times 100 = 75\%
   $$
   **Answer**: 90 is 75% of 120.

5. **Example 5**: Increase 200 by 15%.
   $$
   \text{Solution: } \text{Increase} = \frac{15 \times 200}{100} = 30
   $$
   $$
   \text{New Value: } 200 + 30 = 230
   $$
   **Answer**: 200 increased by 15% is 230.

6. **Example 6**: A product's price decreases from $150 to $120. Find the percentage decrease.
   $$
   \text{Solution: } \text{Decrease} = 150 - 120 = 30
   $$
   $$
   \text{Percentage Decrease} = \left(\frac{30}{150}\right) \times 100 = 20\%
   $$
   **Answer**: The price decreased by 20%.

7. **Example 7**: Convert 45% to a fraction.
   $$
   \text{Solution: } \frac{45}{100} = \frac{9}{20}
   $$
   **Answer**: 45% as a fraction is \( \frac{9}{20} \).

8. **Example 8**: If 30 is 15% of a number, find the number.
   $$
   \text{Solution: } \text{Number} = \frac{30 \times 100}{15} = 200
   $$
   **Answer**: The number is 200.

9. **Example 9**: A student scored 80 out of 100 in a test. What is the percentage?
   $$
   \text{Solution: } \left(\frac{80}{100}\right) \times 100 = 80\%
   $$
   **Answer**: The student scored 80%.

10. **Example 10**: What is the percentage increase from 150 to 180?
    $$
    \text{Solution: } \text{Increase} = 180 - 150 = 30
    $$
    $$
    \text{Percentage Increase} = \left(\frac{30}{150}\right) \times 100 = 20\%
    $$
    **Answer**: The percentage increase is 20%.
